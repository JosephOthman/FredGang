# Connect4 Final Project
### FredGang

## Brief Description
Our project is a remake of Connect4 on the terminal. If you're unfamiliar with Connect4, it's a game where a player's goal is to have 4 discs/chips connecting, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It is set in a 6x7 board like the original. The game ends in a tie if the board is completely filled and no Connect4 is reached. Some extra details are given after running the code.

## Launching the Game
Run the following:
```
git clone git@github.com:JosephOthman/FredGang.git
cd path/to/FredGang
javac *.java
java Woo
```
